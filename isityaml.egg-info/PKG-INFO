        About
        -----
        
        "Is it YAML?" is a Django application for checking whether text is 
        `YAML <http://www.yaml.org/>`_ ("a human friendly data serialization
        standard for all programming languages"), or not. Users type and/or copy
        and paste text and clicks the "Submit" button above. If valid YAML has been
        entered, the input is presented in `canonical form <http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2764652>`_.
        If not, the application presents an error message.
        
        YAML is just a text format for exchanging data. It exists for cases where 
        `XML <http://www.w3.org/XML/>`_ is too much overhead. I like YAML. I find it
        more robust in practice than XML (where one missing angle bracket could corrupt
        a whole file), yet easier to type by hand.
        
        I conjured up "Is it YAML?" while writing a specification for 
        `YPath <https://github.com/peterkmurphy/YPath-Specification>`_ - a language for
        addressing parts of a YAML document, as `XPath <http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/>`_ 
        does for XML. To do a proper job of things, I had to write YAML example files.
        However, I sometimes needed to check if the example files are good and proper.
        "Is it YAML?" gave me a test bed where I can copy-and-paste my examples,
        and see if they really are YAML.
        
        Installation and Dependencies
        -----------------------------
        
        Apart from `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_, the app depends on
        `PyYAML <https://bitbucket.org/xi/pyyaml>`_, a Python parser for YAML. You
        can get the application from PyPI through the command::
        
            pip install isityaml
        
        Once installed, just add "isityaml" to your INSTALLED_APPS list in settings.py,
        and add the desired URL in one of the urls.py files.
        
        The HTML template file used to generate HTML has been redesigned to work with the 
        `Mezzanine <http://mezzanine.jupo.org/>`_ CMS. The redesign removed any explicit
        references to particular stylesheets found with earlier versions. Feel free to
        customise: the app is released under a 3 clause BSD license. See LICENSE.txt for
        more information.
